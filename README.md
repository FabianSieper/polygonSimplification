# polygonSimplification

This project deals with the simplification of polygons. This is used, for example, in the illustration of maps. If the scale is small, for example, streets are shown in a simplified way.

## Usage
To try out the different simplification algorithms, the file main.py must be started. This performs the calculations either on the .gpx file attached via the command line arguments or on a supplied default file and draws the results.
